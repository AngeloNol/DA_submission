# Design Assignments
* DA1 - Write, simulate, and demonstrate using Microchip Studio 7 an assembly code for the AVR
ATMEGA328P/PB microcontroller that performs the following functions:
    1. Store a 16-bit number 0x1234 at SRAM location 0x402. Verify the number stored in the
    location.
    2. Store a 16-bit number in 0x5678 at SRAM location 0x410. Verify the number stored in the
    location.
    3. Sum the above two numbers and store the result in EEPROM starting location. Verify the
    number stored in the location.
    4. Store 10 16-bit numbers starting from 0x0910 at Program Memory location using code and
    retrieve them to 0x500 SRAM location using X pointer. Sum the 10 numbers and store the
    sum in SRAM location 0x406.
